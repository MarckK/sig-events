# SIG Events Proof of Concept - Demo Script

This document is a walk-through running the PoC, from setting up the environment,
then step-by-step how to run the demo.

## Installation

From the `poc` folder, run the poc script.
It will create a kind cluster, install and configure all required components.
The script prerequisites and details are documented within the script itself.

```shell
./poc.sh
```

Login to the [keptn bridge](https://keptn-127.0.0.1.nip.io/bridge/) with the credentials
generated by `keptn configure bridge -o`. The self-signed certificate is not trusted by the
web-browser, ignore the warning and continue to the bridge.

## Running the demo

To kick-off the demo, start the build Tekton pipeline from the `poc` folder:

```shell
tkn pipeline start build-artifact -w name=sources,volumeClaimTemplateFile=./tekton/workspace-template.yaml
```

- Watch the pipeline execution in the [Tekton Dashboard](http://localhost/dashboard)
- Watch the Keptn sequence progress on the [bridge](https://keptn-127.0.0.1.nip.io/bridge/project/cde/sequence)
- Once the sequence is complete the [link](http://localhost/poc/) in the deployment on the bridge opens the deployed demo app
